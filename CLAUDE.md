# AI Development Library - Claude Code

> This file configures how Claude Code should use the skills library for development.

---

## Skills System

This library contains **skills** (code patterns) and **specialized agents** (domain-specific context) that you MUST use BEFORE writing code.

### Critical Rule

**ALWAYS load and read the relevant skills BEFORE writing code.**

No matter how "simple" the task seems. No exceptions. If you don't follow the skill patterns, the code will be rejected.

---

## Automatic Skill Detection

When working with these actions/files, **read the corresponding skill FIRST**:

| If you're...                         | Skill                      | Path                                       |

## Domain Delegation

When a task belongs to a specific domain, **load the corresponding agent** to get full context:

| Domain             | Agent               | When to use                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **UI/Frontend**    | `agents/ui.md`      | Components, styles, animations, accessibility  |
| **Backend/Server** | `agents/backend.md` | Server Actions, APIs, database, business logic |
| **Auth**           | `agents/auth.md`    | Authentication, authorization, RLS, sessions   |
| **Testing**        | `agents/testing.md` | Unit tests, integration, E2E                   |

### How to "Delegate"

Delegation in Claude Code is done by loading additional context:

```
1. Read the agent file (e.g. agents/ui.md)
2. Identify the skills it orchestrates
3. Read each listed skill
4. Execute the task following ALL patterns
```

---

## Pending Improvements

**At the start of every session in this library, read `skills/improvements.md`.**

It contains patterns identified in real usage that haven't been merged into skills yet. Apply them when relevant, even if the official skill doesn't document them yet. If you implement a pending improvement, mark it as applied and suggest merging it into the corresponding skill.

---

## Self-Improvement Signals

**You MUST write a SIGNAL to `skills/improvements.md` whenever you encounter any of these during a task:**

| Signal Type       | When to write it                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SIGNAL:gap`      | You loaded a skill but it was missing a pattern you needed             |
| `SIGNAL:missing`  | You needed a skill that doesn't exist in this library                  |
| `SIGNAL:stale`    | A skill referenced an outdated API, version, or deprecated pattern     |
| `SIGNAL:conflict` | Two loaded skills gave contradictory guidance for the same case        |
| `SIGNAL:unclear`  | A skill rule was ambiguous and you had to guess the intent             |

**Write signals immediately when you notice them — not at the end of the task.**

Signal format (append to `skills/improvements.md`):

```markdown
## [Date] — SIGNAL:[type] — [skill-name or "new-skill"]

**Trigger:** [one sentence: what you were doing when you hit this]
**Gap:** [what was missing, stale, or unclear]
**Suggested fix:** [what the skill should say / what new skill is needed]
**Priority:** Critical | High | Low
```

This is the primary mechanism for the library to improve from real usage. Every signal you write is a future improvement waiting to be merged.

## Meta-Skills

For special library tasks:

| Task                | Skill           | Instructions                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create new skill    | `skill-creator` | Read `skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md` and follow the template |
| Sync AGENTS.md      | `skill-sync`    | Run `./skills/skill-sync/assets/sync.sh`                     |
| Record improvements | `feedback-loop` | Read `skills/feedback-loop/SKILL.md`                         |

---

## Global Rules (Always Apply)

These rules are **NON-NEGOTIABLE** and apply to ALL code:

### Type Safety

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN - Instant rejection
const data: any = await fetch(...)
function process(input: any): any

// REQUIRED - Always explicit types
const data: UserResponse = await fetchUser(id)
function process(input: ProcessInput): ProcessOutput
```

### No Enums

```typescript
// FORBIDDEN
enum UserRole {
  Admin = "ADMIN",
  User = "USER",
}

// REQUIRED - const assertion
const USER_ROLES = { Admin: "ADMIN", User: "USER" } as const;
type UserRole = (typeof USER_ROLES)[keyof typeof USER_ROLES];
```

### Server-First (Next.js)

- Server Components by default
- Client Components only for interactivity
- NEVER use useEffect for data fetching
- NEVER use API routes for internal operations

### Security

- Validate ALL input with Zod
- RLS on ALL Supabase tables
- NEVER trust client-side checks
- NEVER expose internal errors to the user

### Imports

```typescript
// 1. React/Next.js core
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";

// 2. External libraries
import { z } from "zod";

// 3. Internal aliases (alphabetical)
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
```

### Naming Conventions

| Entity             | Convention             | Example                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Files (components) | `kebab-case.tsx`       | `user-profile-card.tsx` |
| Files (utilities)  | `kebab-case.ts`        | `format-date.ts`        |
| React Components   | `PascalCase`           | `UserProfileCard`       |
| Functions          | `camelCase`            | `formatUserDate`        |
| Constants          | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`    |
| Types/Interfaces   | `PascalCase`           | `UserProfile`           |
| Zod Schemas        | `camelCase` + `Schema` | `userProfileSchema`     |

## Workflow

```
User requests something
    ↓
1. Analyze the task — identify domain and technologies
    ↓
2. Load the relevant domain agent (if applicable)
    ↓
3. Load the necessary skills (read each SKILL.md)
    ↓
4. Write code following ALL patterns
    ↓
5. Verify against each skill's checklist
```
